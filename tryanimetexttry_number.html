        In 2010, Maria moved to Canada along with her two children, Derek and Macy.
        Although she had <strong><u> no professional skills, no money, and no connections,</u></strong> she could at least work hard.
        She started from the bottom of the career chain for the second time in her life, working as a waitress and picking up odd jobs.
        <br>
        <br>
        Her first job was as <strong><u>a dishwasher</u></strong> in a Japanese restaurant.
        Before she was given this opportunity, other employers had turned her away because of her <strong><u>poor English</u></strong>.
        Maria worked hard and always took any possible overtime opportunities to make more money, including weekends and holidays.

        <p class="pSecond">“We didn’t know much about life as an immigrant. If you’re alone, it can be a nightmare.” </p>
        She had to ride her bicycle to work every day, no matter if it was raining hard or if there were heavy snow and ice. Before work, she would take the children to school, after that, pick them up again and make them dinner. She worked until 2 am, then got up early to start all over again.
        <br><br>
        Life has not been easy for her. She felt so <strong><u>lonely and helpless </u></strong>because she knew no one here. With the packed schedule, she could not met or know anyone outside from work.

          “The most difficult thing about her life here was the language barrier and social isolation.”
        </p>
         Her limited English made it difficult to communicate with everyone from her neighbours to public officials. When she struggled to find the most basic needs – such as <strong><u>safe housing, food, and medical insurance</strong></u> - she could not even find anyone to help her.
         <br><br>
        In order to find a better job and to allow her children to live better in their new country, she had to use her remaining budget to take <strong><u>English lessons.</u></strong> Because of her age, she could not learn as fast as a child would. Her notebook was full of words, grammars and phrases. Every night, she would sit alone in the kitchen, whispering the words out loud under dim light for fear of waking her children.

        <p>One afternoon, Macy stood alone at the door of the school. Her school play was about to start, but her mother<strong><u> did not appear</u></strong>. Finally, she could not wait any longer and had to take her place. Her classmates wore beautiful costumes and performed their routines on the stage with glee.
          <br><br>
The other children's parents sat in front of the stage, watching their darlings. Macy could only pretend that everything was fine, clap her hands with the rhythm, sing, and dance, and then occasionally look at the teachers and try to smile.
After the performance, Macy ran away for the first time. After she arrived home, she was so sad, holding her toy rabbit tightly and<strong><u> hiding in her room to cry</u></strong>.

      “I didn't know my mother is struggling so much”

    <p>In order to solve the doubts in her heart, Macy watched through her window and crept onto the stairs to listen that night. Through the dim light, she saw everything - her mother <strong><u>typing in front of the computer</u></strong> with a big cup of coffee, then <strong><u>going out at 10 pm.</u></strong>
      <br><br>
It was hard for Macy to imagine how her mother spent her time. After cooking dinner for them both, she still needed to do some freelance typing and then go to another job in the evening in order to make ends meet.
From that night on, little Macy always snuck out of bed secretly, crept on her tiptoes, knelt by the balcony and watched her mother's back disappearing down the road.

      “I lost it when I know I could not afford to
buy a birthday present for my boy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was almost time for Derek’s birthday. Derek had been talking about how much he wanted <strong><u>a toy car</u></strong>. Maria had promised him that he could have a toy car if he worked very hard in school. As a result, he became very active in class and the teacher praised his progress.
      <br><br>
      However, it was nearly the end of the month. Maria needed to <strong><u>pay the rent and buy food</strong></u>, and there were other expenses that could not be put off. Maria opened her wallet and found that there was only change left inside, and not even enough to pay the rent. She was very sad because she just wanted to give her son a nice gift for his birthday.
      When Maria got home, she saw the children painting on the living room floor, watching Peppa Pig together. When Derek looked up, he noticed that Maria was silently welling up, <strong><u>tears filling her eyes.</strong></u>
